# Statistical Learning of Neuronal Functional Connectivity
============== Readme description for Matlab codes =============================

This is the README description for producing results (tables and figures) in simulation studies presented in the paper:

Zhang, C.M., Chai, Y., Guo, X., Gao, M., Devilbiss, D.M., and Zhang, Z. (2016). Statistical learning of neuronal functional connectivity. Technometrics, 58(3):350-359. [https://doi.org/10.5705/ss.202022.0196]

MATLAB codes for all other tables and figures are downloadable from the supplemental material on the jouranl's website: https://doi.org/10.5705/ss.202022.0196.
